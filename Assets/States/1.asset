  storyText: "\tWhat a crummy vacation!\r\n\r\tYou, your little brother Denny, and
    your parents have come to New York City for Christmas vacation. You thought you\u2019d
    get to do a lot of cool things, like visit the Statue of Liberty, ride to the
    top of the Empire State Building, and ice-skate at Rockefeller Center.\r\n\r\tInstead,
    your parents are museum freaks.\r\n\r\t\u201CIt\u2019s entertaining,\u201D your
    mom says as she drags you into the Museum of Natural History.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    educational,\u201D your dad declares as he shows you a collection of ancient pottery.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    boring!\u201D you say, but no one listens.\r\n\r\tAnd the worst part is that you\u2019re
    supposed to be in charge of your little red-haired brother Denny. Only Denny doesn\u2019t
    want anyone to be in charge of him. \u201CYou\u2019re not the boss of me!\u201D
    he keeps saying. You follow your parents through the Museum of Natural History.
    At first it is kind of interesting. You really like the dinosaurs.\r\n\t\u201CWait
    till you see what\u2019s in this room!\u201D your mom cries.\n\n\tPress 1 to go
    to next room"
