  storyText: "\t\u201CPlease help me!\u201D you beg the robot. \u201CI\u2019m looking
    for my brother and \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSilence, intruder,\u201D the robot
    commands. Keeping its laser trained on you, it waves you over to a chair in front
    of one of the monitors.\r\n\t\u201CYou will be my helper in the Teletime room,
    human. I need someone to help me study the past,\u201D the robot explains. It
    points to one of the monitors. \u201CYou will watch this screen all night and
    all day and report to me on what you see.\u201D\r\n\tThat\u2019s not bad, you
    think. At least I\u2019ll get to watch TV!\r\n\tYou settle into one of the cushioned
    chairs opposite the monitor. On the screen, George Washington is crossing the
    Delaware River. You watch him do it again.\r\n\tAnd again.\r\n\tIt\u2019s interesting
    the first few times, but after that you get bored. Really bored.\r\n\tThe days,
    months, and finally years slowly pass. George is still crossing the river. And
    you\u2019re still watching.\r\n\tCompared to this nonstop history lesson, going
    to museums with your parents was a total blast!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
