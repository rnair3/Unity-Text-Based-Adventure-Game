  storyText: "\tYou decide to try to get out of this creepy castle. Using the wall
    to guide you through the darkness, you start back. You\u2019ve only gone a few
    steps when you feel a doorknob with your fingers. You turn it and step into a
    smoky room filled with red light.\r\n\t\u201CWho\u2019s there?\u201D calls a frightened-sounding
    woman. Before you can answer, she cries out, \u201CPlease help me!\u201D\r\n\tYou
    make your way through the smoke toward the sound of her voice. At the back of
    the room, chained to the stone wall, is a beautiful blond woman. She\u2019s dressed
    in a flowing green gown.\r\n\t\u201CHelp me!\u201D she screams. \u201CFind the
    key and unlock the chains before he comes back!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CBefore who comes
    back?\u201D you ask.\r\n\t\u201CThe dragon!\u201D she says. \u201CHe went into
    his den to take a nap. You\u2019ve got to save me!\u201D\r\n\tNow you see an opening
    in the wall. Smoke is pouring out of it with a hissing sound. This must be the
    dragon\u2019s den. You look at the chain holding the woman to the wall. The lock
    is a very strange shape \u2014nearly round.\r\n\t\u201CHurry!\u201D she shrieks.
    \u201CI hear the dragon returning!\u201D\n\n\n\tPress 1 if you dare"
