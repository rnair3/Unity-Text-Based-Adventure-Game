  storyText: "\t\u201CThe magical objects are three white stones,\u201D you tell the
    robot.\r\n\tThe robot\u2019s face is blank. \u201CCorrect,\u201D it says. \u201CBut
    we will see how you do on the next round.\u201D\r\n\tYou know you\u2019re never
    going to make it through the next round. You quickly grasp the chronometer and
    press the button on the right to go farther into the future.\r\n\tImmediately
    you feel a tingling sensation. When it stops, you\u2019re still seated \u2014
    but not on the hard wooden chair in the classroom. Instead, you\u2019re strapped
    into a comfortable, soft seat. Whooshing sounds surround you.\r\n\tIs this an
    airplane?\r\n\tYou glance out a window. Outside is black, empty space, dotted
    with brilliant white stars. Up ahead is a big, doughnut-shaped structure with
    spaceships docked by its doors.\r\n\tYou\u2019re not on an airplane \u2014 you\u2019re
    on a space shuttle! And it\u2019s traveling toward a space station.\r\n\t\u201CThirty
    seconds to docking!\u201D an intercom squawks.\n\n\tTo find out what happens next,
    press 1."
