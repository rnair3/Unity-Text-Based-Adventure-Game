  storyText: "\tYou\u2019ve got to get away from the fierce tyrannosaur. You grab
    Denny\u2019s hand and take off through the trees. The dinosaur chases you, but
    it\u2019s too big to fit easily between the trees.\r\n\tYou and Denny zig one
    way and zag another. Finally the two of you crouch down behind a thick tree trunk.
    You both gasp for air.\r\n\tIn the distance, you can see the tyrannosaur. It glances
    all around. At last it lets out a defeatedsounding roar and ambles off.\r\n\t\u201CWay
    to go!\u201D Denny shouts. You and your brother high-five each other. Now all
    you have to do is go back to the swamp and find the chronometer.\r\n\tBut which
    direction is it? You\u2019ve done so much twisting and turning, you aren\u2019t
    sure where the swamp is.\r\n\tLuckily, Denny seems to remember the way. You follow
    him through the forest and finally come to the swampland. As you rush over to
    the pool of quicksand, all you can think about is the time ticking by.How much
    longer before Denny disappears forever?\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
