  storyText: "\tThe high wooden door to the castle stands open. \u201CHello?\u201D
    you call. \u201CIs anybody home?\u201D\r\n\tYour own voice echoes back. You step
    through the door into a dark entrance hall. Hanging from the wall is a tapestry.
    In the center there\u2019s a picture of a fierce-looking beast.\r\n\tA lion? you
    wonder. You sure hope you don\u2019t run into him here!\r\n\tYou enter a winding,
    narrow corridor. Empty suits of armor line the walls. The only light comes from
    flickering candles.\r\n\tThe corridor turns and twists, but doesn\u2019t seem
    to lead anywhere. You glance at the chronometer. Only one hour left \u2014 and
    there\u2019s still no sign of Denny!\r\n\tThen all the candles go out.\r\n\tYou\u2019re
    in total darkness!\r\n\tFrom somewhere up ahead, you hear an eerie scream. A human
    scream. Chills creep up your spine. Who was that? Maybe you should get out of
    here right now.\r\n\tBut what if it was Denny?\n\n\tIf you choose to go on, press
    1.\r\n\tIf you decide to turn back, press 2."
