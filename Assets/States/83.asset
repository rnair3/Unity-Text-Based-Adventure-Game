    and climb a short flight of steps. At the top, you enter a huge stone room.\r\n\tColorful
    tapestries hang on the walls between narrow, arch-shaped windows. Ladies in long
    gowns sit on wooden benches. Around the room, knights in armor stand stiffly at
    attention.\r\n\tAt the far end of the room, a wooden throne stands on a raised
    platform. Sitting on the throne is a fat, bearded man wearing a red robe and gold
    crown.\r\n\tKing Ruthbert, you realize.\r\n\tNext to him, on a smaller throne,
    is a small person. His crown is too big and slips down over his face.\r\n\tA nearby
    knight draws his sword and raises it to your throat. The sword lightly pricks
    your skin.\r\n\t\u201CWhat are you doing here, stranger?\u201D the knight demands.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
