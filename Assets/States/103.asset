  storyText: "\t\u201CThe three objects are a pin, a pipe, and a potato,\u201D you
    tell the robot.\r\n\t\u201CWRONG!\u201D the teacher thunders. \u201CYou know the
    penalty for a wrong answer! Now step forward!\u201D\r\n\tYou start toward the
    frammilizer. Slowly you feel for the chronometer around your neck. But before
    you can press any buttons, the robot snatches it away with its magnetic claws.\r\n\t\u201CNo
    tricks!\u201D the robot says. \u201CNow enter the frammilizer!\u201D\r\n\tThere\u2019s
    no way out now.\r\n\tAs you step into the strange metal box, your heart sinks
    to the bottom of your toes. You\u2019re a complete failure. You haven\u2019t found
    Denny, and you couldn\u2019t answer the teacher\u2019s question. Then again, you\u2019re
    about to become the first kid you know to be frammilized.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
