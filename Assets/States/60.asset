    the wizard thunders. Instantly, there\u2019s a brilliant flash of light. You find
    yourself in a misty corridor. With a sinking feeling, you realize you are in the
    Corridors of Time.\r\n\tIn the distance you see an old man trudging along, with
    the help of a cane. You hurry to catch up. The man has a white beard and thinning
    gray hair. There\u2019s something familiar about him\u2026.\r\n\t\u201CHi,\u201D
    the old man says in a creaky voice.\r\n\tIt\u2019s Denny! Somehow the Corridors
    of Time have turned him into an old man!\r\n\tYou grab his arm. \u201CDenny,\u201D
    you say, \u201Ccome on. Maybe we can find a way out of here.\u201D\r\n\tHe shakes
    off your hand. \u201CYou\u2019re not the boss of me,\u201D he grumbles. Then he
    bops you on the head with his cane. \u201CI\u2019m older now \u2014 and I\u2019m
    the boss of you!\u201D\r\n\tToo bad. You\u2019re stuck in time with your older
    younger brother!\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
