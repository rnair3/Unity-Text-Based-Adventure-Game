  storyText: "\tYou rush to the next room, expecting something exciting. But your
    mom is standing in front of a sundial. \u201CIsn\u2019t this wonderful?\u201D
    she exclaims. \u201CAn exhibit on time!\u201D\r\n\tGreat, you think. A whole roomful
    of clocks! Boring!\r\n\tThen Denny gives you a karate kick in the back of the
    leg.\r\n\t\u201COw!\u201D you cry. \u201CStop it!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re
    not the boss of me!\u201D he says smugly.\r\n\t\u201CYes, I am!\u201D you reply,
    punching him in the arm. He whines and complains to your parents. You can\u2019t
    win!\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m thirsty,\u201D Denny says now. You can see he\u2019s
    eaten almost half a bag of Gummi Bears in less than a minute.\r\n\t\u201CCan you
    find a drinking fountain for Denny, dear?\u201D your mom asks without taking her
    eyes off a grandfather clock.\r\n\t\u201CCome on.\u201D You grab Denny\u2019s
    hand. But Denny pulls away and runs off down a hallway. You follow him. The hallway
    twists and turns. There\u2019s no sign of either Denny or a water fountain. But
    near the end of the hall you see a sign on a door:\r\n\r\n\tWARNING!\r\n\tDANGEROUS
    EXPERIMENT INSIDE\r\n\tTHIS DOOR MUST BE KEPT LOCKED AT ALL TIMES\n\n\tPress 1
    to go on to next room"
