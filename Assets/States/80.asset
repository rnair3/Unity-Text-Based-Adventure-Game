  storyText: "\tYou tear down the corridor to the Hydroponics area.\r\n\tWhat a jungle!
    Thick, green leaves and winding vines creep all around the room. Strange-looking
    plants grow everywhere. You notice they\u2019re all potted in a pink solution
    that is bubbling furiously.\r\n\tYou watch the doorway as you look around. The
    robots may catch up to you at any minute.\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D you call. \u201CAre
    you in here?\u201D\r\n\tYou wander past odd-shaped leaves, strange-smelling flowers,
    and heavy, colorful fruits. You\u2019ve never seen anything like them. You wonder
    if something in outer space caused ordinary earth plants to mutate into strange
    new forms.\r\n\tYou come to a large sign that reads DANGER.\r\n\tHuh? What could
    be dangerous in a room of plants?\r\n\tThen you see it: a vine with a stem as
    thick as an elephant\u2019s leg. Its flower is huge, with sharplooking petals.\r\n\tYou
    step forward for a closer look. Suddenly the flower lunges at you, its petals
    snapping shut an inch from your nose!\n\n\n\tBack away and press 1."
