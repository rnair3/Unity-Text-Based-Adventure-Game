  storyText: "\t\u201CWhat?\u201D you cry. You stare at the scientist. Your parents
    are going to ground you for life if you lose Denny.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019ll have
    to travel in time to find him,\u201D Dr. Peebles tells you. \u201CI\u2019d better
    make those adjustments to the Chronoport so you don\u2019t disappear into timelessness,
    too!\u201D\r\n\tYou stare at the scientist as he fiddles with the time machine.
    You can\u2019t believe it \u2014 this guy is really serious!\r\n\t\u201CWhen you
    find your brother,\u201D Dr. Peebles goes on, \u201Cyou must be touching each
    other before you use the chronometer. Otherwise, the device will bring only one
    of you back.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo problem,\u201D you say. \u201CBut where did Denny
    go? The future or the past?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s no way to know whether
    he\u2019s gone forward in time \u2014 or back,\u201D Dr. Peebles replies. \u201CYou\u2019ll
    have to guess.\u201D\r\n\tYou touch the chronometer around your neck. It began
    measuring real time the moment Denny disappeared. Already the seconds are ticking
    by. You have to decide: Are you more likely to find Denny in the past or in the
    future?\n\n\n\tPress 1 to travel to the future.\r\n\tPress 2 and go to the past
