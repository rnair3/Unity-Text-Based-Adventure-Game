  storyText: "\tYou take off after your brother. But by the time you reach the tree
    where you last saw him, he\u2019s gone.\r\n\tThen something on the ground near
    the tree catches your eye. It\u2019s the chronometer. But where\u2019s Denny?
    And why did he leave the chronometer behind?\r\n\tYou scoop up the device and
    run your finger over the buttons. Denny said he wanted to do something else. He
    was probably bored with the past and decided to go to the future.\r\n\tYou quickly
    press the button on the right and feel a tingling sensation.\r\n\tA purple mist
    surrounds you. Everything turns blurry. You close your eyes, hoping your dizziness
    will pass.\r\n\tYou open your eyes again. And blink. Twice.\r\n\tA futuristic-looking
    city looms in the distance.\n\n\tPress 1 to enter the city."
