    of TV monitors.\r\n\tOn the monitors you can see several scenes from the past:
    Alexander the Great\u2019s army, the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
    the landing on the moon. A robot in a white lab coat watches the monitors and
    doesn\u2019t notice you.\r\n\tMaybe the robot can help you return to your own
    time. You\u2019re about to ask for help when an alarm sounds.\r\n\t\u201CATTENTION
