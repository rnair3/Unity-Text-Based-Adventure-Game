  storyText: "\tYou hold your breath and brace yourself as you fall toward the bubbling
    pot.\r\n\tYou pull your arms into your chest. And your hand hits a button. A button
    on the chronometer!\r\n\tYour body begins to tingle. You close your eyes and cross
    your fingers. And then you land.\r\n\tBut not in bubbling oil!\r\n\tBlinking,
    you gaze around. You\u2019re in a room. Dr. Peebles\u2019s lab. You made it back
    to the present!\r\n\t\u201CWelcome, time traveler!\u201D Dr. Peebles greets you.
    \u201CHow did it go?\u201D\r\n\tYou\u2019re about to answer when you remember
    Denny. Oh, no! You left Denny in the past.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ve got to save my
    brother \u2014\u201D you start to say. And then you remember the pot of oil. The
    boiling oil. A lot Denny did for me when I was about to be fried! you think.\r\n\t\u201CExcellent!\u201D
    you say to Dr. Peebles. \u201CEverything was excellent.\u201D\r\n\tThen you head
    back toward the museum exhibits. Of course, now you have to explain to your parents
    why their youngest son is now called Ruthelford and lives in medieval times!\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to continue"
