    hope you\u2019re right.\u201D Dr. Peebles punches another computer key. \u201CAre
    you ready? Step through the Chronoport.\u201D\r\n\tYou enter the glowing frame.
    As you move through it you feel a strange tingling sensation.\r\n\t\u201COne more
    thing!\u201D Dr. Peebles calls out. His voice sounds far away. \u201CBefore you
    can return, remember \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhat?\u201D you cry as his words
    fade away. What was he saying?\r\n\tAhead of you in the mist are two scenes: a
    big, futuristic-looking city with small cars flying around like planes.\r\n\tAnother
    view seems to be of New York City. You recognize a few buildings, like One World
    Trade Center and the Empire State Building. As you watch, a small red-haired boy
    who looks like Denny disappears behind another tall building. But is it really
    your brother?\r\n\tMake a decision!\r\n\n\tPress 1 if you think that Denny is
    in the strange city? \n\tOr is he the red-haired boy in New York then press 2."
