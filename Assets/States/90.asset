  storyText: "\t\u201CA red-haired boy is visiting the space station,\u201D you tell
    the robot. \u201CCan your machine find him?\u201D\r\n\t\u201COf course,\u201D
    the robot says, twisting some dials.\r\n\tDenny\u2019s face ripples across the
    screen. He\u2019s crouched underneath a table that holds a large computer. As
    you stare at your brother you realize the table is in this very room!\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D
    you cry. You run toward the table. Denny is still huddled there, too scared to
    move or speak.\r\n\tSwiftly, you duck past the robot and under the desk.\r\n\t\u201CNo!\u201D
    the robot cries, coming after you. But you grab your brother\u2019s hand, then
    press the top and bottom buttons on the chronometer. As Dr. Peebles instructed,
    you hold them down for five seconds.\n\n\tPress 1 to travel"
