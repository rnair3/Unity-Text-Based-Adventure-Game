  storyText: "\tYou take off after the knight on horseback. The enormous stone castle
    stretches toward the sky. Flags fly from its turrets.\r\n\tYou imagine living
    there. Cool! you think.\r\n\tSuddenly you notice that the knight has disappeared.
    Where did he go?\r\n\tYou hurry over a drawbridge, which stretches over a moat.
    The moat surrounds the castle.\r\n\tThe sound of thundering hooves breaks the
    silence. The knight is returning, at full speed. And now he\u2019s holding a spear
    \u2014 and pointing it at you!\r\n\t\u201CHey!\u201D you call out. \u201CI\u2019m
    not your enemy! I\u2019m a visitor from the future!\u201D\r\n\tBut the knight
    doesn\u2019t pay attention. His horse gallops closer and closer. The tip of the
    knight\u2019s spear gleams in the sun.\r\n\tUh-oh. This guy looks pretty serious.
    Are you ready to face him? Or should you jump into the moat below, even though
    you\u2019re a terrible swimmer?\n\n\n\r\tPress 1 to face the knight.\r\n\tPress
    2 to jump into the moat."
