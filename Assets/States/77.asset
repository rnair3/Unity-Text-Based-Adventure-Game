  storyText: "\tStrolling down the block in front of you is a familiar-looking family:
    a father, a mother, and two kids. There\u2019s a very good reason why the family
    looks so familiar. It\u2019s your family.\r\n\tYou watch as your Mom, Dad, Denny,
    and you continue down the block. Your parents are talking to each other, and you
    and Denny seem to be arguing \u2014 some things will never change.\r\n\tYou watch
    as Denny gives you a karate chop in the arm, and you punch him back.\r\n\tIt feels
    so strange to watch yourself like this. There are two of you in the same place!
    What would happen if you spoke to your future self?\r\n\tYou still haven\u2019t
    decided what to do when your family reaches the corner. The light changes and
    they start to cross to the other side of the street.\r\n\tA moment later you hear
    frightened screams and shouts, and then loud honking. You turn toward the noise.
    A green truck is speeding down the street.\r\n\tThe truck shows no sign of slowing
    down, and it\u2019s headed straight toward your family!\n\n\tQuick!! Press 1"
