  storyText: "\tYou start up the metallic ladder, making sure that the red box is
    still inside your pocket. The building is at least thirty stories high. At the
    top of the steps is a pulsing green glow.\r\n\tThe power source, you realize.\r\n\tYou
    climb faster. Soon you are at the top of the ladder, staring at a huge, green-glowing
    orb inside a round room with glass panels.\r\n\tThe glow is so bright you can
    hardly see. You look for a way into the room and finally notice a small door with
    a sign: EXTREME DANGER. DO NOT ENTER.\r\n\tBut you have to enter, to leave the
    explosive device.\r\n\tOr do you?\r\n\tJarmal said only that the explosive device
    needed to be within three feet of the power source. He never said it had to be
    in the same room. Maybe you\u2019re already close enough.\r\n\tDecide what to
    do right away \u2014 a robot guard is coming!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to enter the room,
    turn.\r\n\tOr press 2 to place the device against the wall and see what happens."
