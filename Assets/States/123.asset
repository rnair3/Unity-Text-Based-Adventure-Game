  storyText: "\tYou grab the rake. Then, holding it out in front of you, you inch
    toward the door on the other side of the room. The vine follows you, its flower
    head still snapping like mad.\r\n\tYou\u2019re about to reach for the doorknob
    when something grabs your ankle.\r\n\tThe vine is coiling around your legs!\r\n\tDesperately,
    you hack at the vine with the rake. But it\u2019s no use. The vine rapidly works
    its way up your body, wrapping you up as tightly as a mummy!\r\n\tSuddenly, the
    door opens. Someone walks in, singing the words to your favorite song.\r\n\tIt\u2019s
    Denny!\r\n\tYou open your mouth to yell to him. But it\u2019s no use. You can\u2019t
    speak \u2014 you can\u2019t even move.\r\n\tYou hear Denny moving around the room,
    looking at everything. Then he stops right in front of you.\r\n\tHe looks closely
    at the vine holding you prisoner. \u201CCool plant,\u201D he says.\r\n\tCool plant?\r\n\tThat\u2019s
    not a plant \u2014 it\u2019s you!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
