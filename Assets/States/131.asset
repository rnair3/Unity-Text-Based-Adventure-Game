    ship is a woman. A human woman \u2014 but she looks really mean.\r\n\t\u201CYou
    were caught spying in our secret antigravity device,\u201D she says sternly. \u201CThe
    penalty is immediate execution. Now what do you have to say for yourself?\u201D\r\n\tImmediate
    execution!\r\n\tSomehow, you have to get her to understand what you were doing
    there. But what if she doesn\u2019t believe your story? Maybe it would be better
    to pretend you\u2019re a new member of the space crew and didn\u2019t know better.\r\n\tDecide
    well. Your life depends on it!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to lie.\r\n\tPress 1 to tell the
    truth."
