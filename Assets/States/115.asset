  storyText: "\t\u201CHuman spies!\u201D the robot with the laser gun declares. \u201CYou
    are under arrest!\u201D\r\n\tYou untwist yourself and float out of the chamber.
    \u201CWe weren\u2019t spying!\u201D you protest. \u201CWe were only \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSilence!\u201D
    the robot snaps.\r\n\tIn a panic, you pull out the chronometer and take a glance.
    You and Denny have to get home.\r\n\t\u201CPlease,\u201D you beg the robot. \u201CI
    have to get my brother \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CExplain it to the captain!\u201D
    the robot says. It snatches away the chronometer.\r\n\t\u201CNo!\u201D you scream.
    \u201CGive that back!\u201D You grab for the chronometer, but the robot holds
    it beyond your reach. \u201CCome along now!\u201D it snarls. It clamps its metal
    claws around your wrist. \u201CYou, too!\u201D it adds, reaching for Denny.\r\n\t\u201CYou
    can\u2019t make me!\u201D Denny kicks the robot hard on its metal shin and takes
    off running.\r\n\tThe robot stops for a moment. You can hear something whirring
    inside its head. \u201CThe captain will explain what to do,\u201D it mutters.
    \u201CNow come with me.\u201D\n\n\n\tPress 1 to go on."
