  storyText: "\tDangerous experiment? What does that mean? you wonder. You notice
    that the door is slightly open. Oh, no! Denny must have run in here, you think.\r\n\tYou
    push the door open wider and peek in. There\u2019s no sign of Denny. A tall, skinny
    man with long white hair tied in a ponytail is bent over a computer. The computer
    is hooked up to a big, strange-looking clock. Between the computer and the clock
    is a large square contraption that looks like a picture frame. You can hear the
    computer and the clock beeping and pinging.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s about time you
    got here!\u201D the tall man says, straightening up. \u201CI\u2019m Dr. Peebles.
    You must be the volunteer.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CActually,\u201D you start to say,
    \u201CI\u2019m looking for \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s no time to waste!\u201D
    Dr. Peebles interrupts. \u201CI\u2019m ready to start the experiment. Come on
    over.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWell, I \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHere!\u201D he says. He
    places a chain around your neck. On the end of the chain is something that looks
    like a stopwatch. A very, very odd stopwatch, with a complicated-looking dial
    and four big knobs.\r\n\t\u201CAre you ready?\u201D Dr. Peebles asks.\n\n\tPress
    1 to continue...."
