    wheel.\r\n\tYou try to pull the truck to the right, but it\u2019s much harder
    than you thought. The horrified faces of your family \u2014 including your own
    \u2014 loom in the windshield.\r\n\t\u201CGET OUT OF THE WAY!\u201D you scream.\r\n\tIn
    desperation, you pull again on the wheel. With a sudden lurch, the truck veers

    saved your family!\r\n\tBut you\u2019d better hold on tight. You still can\u2019t
    stop the truck. And this time the runaway vehicle is headed right at a brick wall!
