  storyText: "\tThe huge tyrannosaur towers over the other dinosaurs. It\u2019s bigger
    than you ever imagined. Its teeth are as long and sharp as carving knives.\r\n\tThe
    enormous creature lets out a roar as it crosses the grassy plain. You freeze.
    Your heart pounds in terror.\r\n\tThe other dinosaurs all start to run away. But
    one, who was grazing on ferns, is slower than the others. The tyrannosaur easily
    catches up to it, and tears off the small dinosaur\u2019s head in one bite!\r\n\tThen
    the tyrannosaur swings its head and stares straight at you! You take off as fast
    as you can. The tyrannosaur follows. Closer and closer.\r\n\tAhead there\u2019s
    a swampy patch of land. You race toward it. Something small is sitting in the
    middle of the swamp.\r\n\tIt\u2019s Denny!\r\n\tBut what\u2019s he doing? Why
    isn\u2019t he moving?\r\n\tYou glance back over your shoulder. The dinosaur is
    still right behind you.\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D you call out. \u201CRun!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI
    can\u2019t,\u201D he yells back. \u201CI\u2019m stuck in quicksand!\u201D\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to help your brother."
