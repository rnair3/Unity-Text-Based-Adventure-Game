  storyText: "\tYou decide to sneak in through the air duct. Jarmal leads you through
    the trees to the back of the power plant. The air duct is a small opening near
    ground level. Slipping the red box of explosives under your shirt, you climb into
    the opening. Then you begin to inch your way along the duct.\r\n\tThe duct is
    so small you can scarcely move. As you go farther in, the space becomes even tighter.
    You crawl another foot \u2014 then realize you are stuck! You can\u2019t go forward,
    and you can\u2019t go back. And your hands are trapped at your sides. You can\u2019t
    reach the explosives or the chronometer.\r\n\tYou are about to yell for help when
    you hear shouting outside.\r\n\tWhump!\r\n\tLaser guns fire. The robots must have
    found the rebels!\r\n\t\u201CThe small human is in the air duct, Commander!\u201D
    a robot says. \u201CWe\u2019ll close the air duct so it can\u2019t breathe!\u201D\r\n\tCLANG!\r\n\tThe
    cover of the air duct bangs shut.\r\n\tLooks like you\u2019ve picked the wrong
    side in this battle, human. Sadly, your adventure has come to a breathtaking.\n\n\tPress
    1 to continue."
