  storyText: "\t\u201CIt\u2019s King Henry\u2019s army!\u201D King Ruthbert shouts.\r\n\tThe
    king\u2019s two knights spring into action. They drop you and jump in front of
    the king. They desperately try to defend him against the invading army.\r\n\tWhen
    the knights let you go, you roll out of the way. You\u2019ve got to grab Denny
    and get out of here. Fast!\r\n\tBut one of King Henry\u2019s knights has already
    seized your brother. You watch in horror as the knight lifts your brother over
    his head and walks him over to the end of the castle.\r\n\tOh, no! The knight\u2019s
    about to toss Denny over the side!\r\n\tYou\u2019ve got to do something, but what?
    For just a moment you think about doing nothing. After all, Denny was planning
    to have you boiled in oil. But no \u2014 he\u2019s your brother, after all.\r\n\tYour
    hands are still tied behind your back. Maybe you can trick the knight into letting
    Denny go. Or \u2014 maybe you can roll into the knight\u2019s path before he reaches
    the edge of the roof.\n\n\n\tTrick the knight by pressing 1.\r\n\tRoll into his
    path and press 2."
