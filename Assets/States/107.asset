    shocked as mice scamper out of the truck and all over the loading dock.\r\n\t\u201CHey
    you,\u201D you hear Abe call to the driver of the green truck. \u201CGet out of
    that truck and help us clear up this mess.\u201D\r\n\tCongratulations, time traveler.
    The truck drivers are so busy chasing white mice that the green truck doesn\u2019t
    get to the intersection until way after your family is out of there.\r\n\tYou
    did it! You\u2019re a hero. You saved your family. And you saved the lives of
    two thousand white mice.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
