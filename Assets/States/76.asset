    and get out of here. But you have to find your brother.\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D
    you shout.\r\n\tYou put your hand on the walls to guide you. A light appears up
    ahead, and you follow it into a circular room.\r\n\tInside the room are three
    doors. You just came through one of them. The other two are labeled TO KING RUTHBERT\u2019S
    THRONE ROOM and TO THE LAIR.\r\n\tYou remember that the knight warned you to \u201CBeware
    of the Lair.\u201D Did he mean this lair?\r\n\tWhat about the Throne Room? Judging
    by this spooky castle, that could be pretty dangerous, too.\r\n\tWhich door do
    you choose?\n\n\n\tPress 1 to enter the Throne Room.\r\n\tPress 2 to step into
    the Lair."
