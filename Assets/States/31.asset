  storyText: "\tYou feel a strange tingling sensation as you press the buttons on
    the chronometer. When it stops you\u2019re still standing next to a newsstand.
    But a clock in a nearby store shows that it\u2019s fifteen minutes before the
    accident.\r\n\tYou can still stop it from happening!\r\n\tYour family has already
    started toward the corner.\r\n\tYou don\u2019t have much time! Should you do something
    to distract them? Or \u2014 just run across the street and warn them?\r\n\tThink
    fast! The seconds are ticking by rapidly!\n\n\tDistract your family by pressing
    1.\r\n\tWarn them on by pressing 2."
