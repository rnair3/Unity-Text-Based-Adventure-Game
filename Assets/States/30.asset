  storyText: "\tThe knight takes the club and holds it awkwardly.\r\n\tThis should
    be easy, you think as you pick an apple. You throw it to him \u2014 a fast pitch.
    To your surprise, he hits it \u2014 but the apple only flies a few feet.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019ll
    never be able to beat that,\u201D the knight says.\r\n\t\u201CWe\u2019ll see,\u201D
    you reply. He\u2019s never seen you play ball.\r\n\tYou grip the club tightly
    as the knight picks an apple. He winds up, then tosses it toward you.\r\n\tYou
    keep your eye fixed on the shiny red ball as it soars through the air. You shouldn\u2019t
    have any problem hitting this baby.\r\n\tYou reach back with your bat and start
    to swing. Then the bat connects \u2014 with empty air! You missed!\r\n\t\u201CWait!\u201D
    you cry. \u201CLet me try again.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSorry,\u201D the knight says.
    \u201CYou can\u2019t change the rules.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CBut \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThe
    crocodiles are hungry.\u201D The knight picks you up in both his arms. \u201CIt\u2019s
    past their lunchtime!\u201D\r\n\tYou start to reach for the chronometer. But it\u2019s
    too late. You\u2019re falling \u2014 falling into the moat. Below you are a dozen
    snapping jaws.\r\n\tToo bad, batting champ! You\u2019ve struck out big time!\n\n\tPress
    1 to continue."
