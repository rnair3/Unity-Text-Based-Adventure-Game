  storyText: "\t\u201CI\u2019m ready to travel through time!\u201D you tell Dr. Peebles.\r\n\t\u201CGood,\u201D
    the white-haired man replies. He punches some numbers into the computer keyboard.
    The computer starts to hum. The square doorway between the clock and the computer
    fills with a strange, shimmering glow. \u201CThe Chronoport is almost ready,\u201D
    the scientist says, pointing to the frame. \u201CI only need to adjust \u2014\u201D\r\n\tBut
    before he can continue, you hear pounding footsteps. You turn to see Denny racing
    toward you.\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D you cry. He\u2019s heading straight for the
    Chronoport. \u201CYou can\u2019t go in there!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re not
    the boss of me!\u201D Denny yells. He runs straight through the glowing frame.
    There\u2019s a soft pop before he disappears completely.\r\n\t\u201COh, no!\u201D
    Dr. Peebles cries. \u201CHe went before I made the final settings! If you don\u2019t
    bring him back within two hours of real time, he\u2019ll disappear into timelessness
    forever!\u201D\n\n\tPress 1 to race on!!!!!!!"
