  storyText: "\tYou decide to take your chances in the moat.\r\n\tSPLASH! The water
    is cold \u2014 but at least you escaped that fierce-looking knight.\r\n\tThen
    you hear it \u2014 a loud clacking sound.\r\n\tA crocodile snapping his jaws.
    He\u2019s right in front of you! And he looks mighty hungry!\r\n\tYou turn away
    from the crocodile and swim in the opposite direction. You wish you could swim
    faster. The crocodile\u2019s gaining on you!\r\n\tSuddenly another crocodile pops
    up in your path. And another.\r\n\tYou\u2019re totally surrounded by hungry green
    crocodiles!\r\n\tYou grab for the chronometer around your neck. But before you
    can press the buttons, the crocodile nearest you snatches it out of your hand.\r\n\tIn
    one gulp, he swallows it!\r\n\tToo bad. The chronometer was only the appetizer.
    The main course is about to be served \u2014 and it\u2019s you!\n\n\n\tPress 1
    to continue"
