  storyText: "\tYou walk over to the loading area, hoping you\u2019ll be able to convince
    someone to stop the green truck. But how?\r\n\t\u201CWhat are you doing daydreaming?\u201D
    Abe bellows. He\u2019s a huge scary man. \u201CStart loading, NOW.\u201D\r\n\tYou
    lift the first crate. It\u2019s heavy, but you manage to hoist it into the back
    of the truck. That wasn\u2019t so bad \u2014 it\u2019s the next thirty or so that
    wear you out.\r\n\tYour back is breaking, but every time you stop \u2014 even
    for a second \u2014 Abe is there saying \u201CLoad!\u201D So you keep an eye on
    the green truck as you load.\r\n\tTo your horror, you see the driver of the green
    truck climbing into the front seat and getting ready to go. You\u2019ve got to
    stop him! You start to run over to him, but Abe is coming around the corner. Can
    you get away from Abe? That\u2019s a matter of luck. Are you wearing something
    green today?\n\n\n\tIf you\u2019re wearing green, press 1.\r\n\tIf you\u2019re
    not, press 2."
