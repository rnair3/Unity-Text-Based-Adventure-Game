  storyText: "\t\u201CWelcome to the rebel forces!\u201D Jarmal cries, shaking your
    hand. He shows you a map of The City and explains the battle plan. \u201CThis
    building beams power to all the robots,\u201D he says, pointing to a large plant
    on the map. \u201CIf we can blow up this power plant, the robots will become helpless.\u201D\r\n\tNext,
    Jarmal shows you a small, red box. \u201CThis box contains a special explosive,\u201D
    he explains. \u201CIt must be placed within three feet of the power source.\u201D\r\n\tYou
    follow Jarmal through the tunnel to a stairway leading to a park. Through the
    trees you see the power plant. It\u2019s a tall, white, completely round building
    with a large antenna extending from the roof.\r\n\tJarmal tells you that all entrances
    are heavily guarded by robots. \u201CSince none of the robots will recognize you,
    you\u2019ve been chosen to enter the power plant,\u201D he says.\r\n\t\u201CWhat?\u201D
    you exclaim. \u201CYou want me to enter the power plant?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CDidn\u2019t
    I mention it before?\u201D asks Jarmal. \u201COur entire plan depends on you.
    Are you ready?\u201D\n\n\r\n\tAre you? Then press 1"
