  storyText: "\t\u201CI\u2019m a new crew member,\u201D you lie to the captain. \u201CI\u2019m
    not a spy. I\u2019ve been working in the Hydroponics area.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThen
    why didn\u2019t you know the antigrav device is off limits?\u201D she demands.\r\n\t\u201CI
    haven\u2019t finished reading the rule book,\u201D you say.\r\n\t\u201CMaybe so,\u201D
    the captain grumbles. She hesitates, then fires a question at you. \u201CAre the
    crew quarters forward or aft?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CAft,\u201D you reply, hoping you\u2019re
    right.\r\n\t\u201CThat\u2019s correct,\u201D she says. \u201CBut if you are a
    real crew member, what is the code for a space drill? A-Zero or X-Two?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CA-Zero,\u201D
    you tell her.\r\n\t\u201CYou are an imposter and a spy!\u201D she shouts in triumph.
    \u201CThere is no space drill \u2014 and even the newest rookie knows it!\u201D
    She turns to the robot guards at her side. \u201CShove this spy out through the
    airlock!\u201D she orders.\r\n\t\u201CHey \u2014 what about partial credit?\u201D
    you yell. But it\u2019s no good. As you step out of the airlock, your whole body
    explodes.\r\n\tVery messy. Very scary. Very much.\n\n\tPress 1 to continue...."
