  storyText: "\tYou grab Denny\u2019s hand and press the chronometer buttons to escape.\r\n\tNothing
    happens.\r\n\t\u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D Denny whines, tugging at your
    arm.\r\n\t\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D you snap.\r\n\tYou let go of Denny\u2019s
    hand and stare closely at the face of the chronometer. It looks okay. Same as
    always. You wonder what went wrong.\r\n\tThen the lion roars. Loudly!\r\n\tYou
    shake the chronometer up and down. And try pressing the buttons again. Your body
    starts to tingle.\r\n\tIt\u2019s working! you think. You shut your eyes tightly.
    Your fingertips tingle with what feels like an electric current.\r\n\tYou open
    your eyes. You can\u2019t believe it! You\u2019re not back in Dr. Peebles\u2019s
    lab. You\u2019re still in the castle. In front of a door that says KING RUTHBERT\u2019S
    THRONE ROOM.\r\n\tThe lion is gone. But where is Denny?\r\n\tAnd then you remember
    \u2014 you didn\u2019t hold Denny\u2019s hand. You\u2019ve lost him all over again!
    And time\u2019s running out!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to search for Denny again"
