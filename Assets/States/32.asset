    you yell. \u201CDenny!\u201D\r\n\tYou\u2019re getting used to the smell and the
    darkness. You squint at the chronometer and see that there\u2019s only about fifteen
    minutes until you and Denny are lost in time forever.\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D
    you call again.\r\n\tAt last you hear his faint answer. \u201CHelp me!\u201D he
    calls. The sound is coming from underneath the straw.\r\n\tYou dig through the
    straw. Finally you find him, on the bottom, with ropes tied around his hands and
    feet.\r\n\t\u201CWho tied you up?\u201D you ask as you quickly untie him.\r\n\t\u201CThe
    lion,\u201D he says.\r\n\tA lion tied him up?\r\n\t\u201CCome on,\u201D you say

    your hand.\r\n\tYou get ready to press the top and bottom buttons of the chronometer.
    But a terrifying roar fills the cave.\n\n\tFind out what it is by pressing 1."
