  storyText: "\tThe knight uses his sharp sword to slash the ropes around your arms.
    You\u2019re free!\r\n\tBefore the knight can question you further, you jump up
    and karate kick the sword from his hand.\r\n\tThe sword falls to the ground. You
    can\u2019t believe the karate lessons you took last summer worked! You karate
    kick the knight again.\r\n\tAnd lose your balance.\r\n\tYou reach out and grab
    Denny and tumble to the ground, hitting a button on the chronometer.\r\n\tYou
    sprawl on the ground, dizzy. And then you hear it. \u201CAll hail the king! All
    hail the king!\u201D\r\n\tYou gaze up and gasp. You\u2019re in a strange land.
    And hundreds of people are chanting and bowing. Bowing to you!\r\n\tYou are the
    king!\r\n\tYou stand up and give your first order. \u201CTake this slave boy away,\u201D
    you say, pointing at Denny. \u201CI am the boss now.\u201D\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
