    you stand. You hold your breath as the teacher starts to speak. This is the moment.
    Can you answer the question, or will you be frammilized?\r\n\t\u201CThe ancient
    British wizard Morgred used a magic spell to travel in time. The spell made use
    of three magical objects. What are they?\u201D\r\n\tMorgred? He was the wizard
    in the GOOSEBUMPS book A Night in Terror Tower. You remember him. But can you
    remember the answer to the question? If you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to guess!
    Think carefully, then answer.\n\n\n\n\tPress 1 if you think the three objects
    a pin, a pipe, and a potato? If so.\r\n\tOr press 2 if you think the magical objects
    three white stones? If that is your answer."
