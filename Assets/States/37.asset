  storyText: "\t\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D you tell Jarmal. \u201CI hope the humans
    win over the robots. But I\u2019ve got to go look for my brother.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThat\u2019s
    bad news \u2014 for you,\u201D Jarmal says. \u201CBut it\u2019s good news for
    us. We\u2019ve been looking for someone to use as bait to lure the robots into
    the underground tunnels.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWait a minute!\u201D you say. \u201CI\u2019ve
    changed my mind! I want to join the rebel \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSorry,\u201D
    Jarmal replies. \u201CIt\u2019s too late.\u201D He snatches the chronometer and
    crushes it beneath his boots.\r\n\t\u201CBut I\u2019m a fellow human!\u201D you
    protest, as Jarmal and two other humans drag you back to the manhole.\r\n\t\u201CIt
    makes no difference,\u201D Jarmal snarls. \u201CIf there\u2019s one thing five
    hundred years of robot rule has taught us, it\u2019s not to be sentimental.\u201D\r\n\tThe
    rebels tie you to the top of the manhole. Then Jarmal and his friends gather below,
    their guns drawn and ready. Outside on the street you can hear gunfire \u2014
    and it\u2019s getting closer.\r\n\tWhen the robots arrive, you\u2019ll be caught
    between the two opposing armies. Too bad. It looks as if you\u2019ve gotten tied
    up in one adventure too many!\n\n\tPress 1 to continue.."
