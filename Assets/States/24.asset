  storyText: "\tDisguised in the uniform, you hurry out of the closet to explore the
    space station.\r\n\tThis place is too cool. Through the windows you can see thousands
    of stars. Sophisticated-looking computers with colorful lights are scattered all
    over this place.\r\n\tThe chronometer\u2019s steady ticking reminds you that time
    is running out. You\u2019d better find Denny quickly and get back to the present.\r\n\tYou
    wander through a door and see a sign pointing to something called TELETIME.\r\n\tThen
    two robots approach. One of them draws a laser.\r\n\tJust ahead is a branch in
    the corridor. A green sign points to HYDROPONICS and a purple one points to ENGINE
    ROOM.\r\n\tMake a choice and start running!\n\n\tFollow the green sign to Hydroponics
    and press 1.\n\tTake the purple sign to the Engine Room  and press 2."
