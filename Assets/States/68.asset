  storyText: "\tYou get ready to make your escape from the classroom. You need to
    find your brother before his time runs out, but it\u2019s too dangerous to stay
    here.\r\n\tNow the robot is questioning the girl sitting in front of you. While
    she stammers out an answer, you grasp the chronometer.\r\n\tWhere should you go?
    Do you think you might find Denny in a time farther in the future? Or perhaps
    he\u2019s in the past? Maybe you should return to Dr. Peebles\u2019s laboratory
    and ask his help in finding your brother.\r\n\tWhatever you decide to do, choose
    now! The teacher is about to question you!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to return to the laboratory
    for Dr. Peebles\u2019s help?\n\tPress 2 to seek Denny farther in the future?\n\tOr
    press 3 to look for him in the past?\n"
