  storyText: "\t\u201CUse the key and open the lock!\u201D the woman begs.\r\n\tYou
    hear the dragon\u2019s heavy footsteps approaching. \u201CWhat key?\u201D you
    ask.\r\n\t\u201CThe key around your neck!\u201D\r\n\tYou glance down at the chronometer.
    It seems to be the same shape as the keyhole. \u201CBut this isn\u2019t a key,\u201D
    you protest. \u201CIt\u2019s a chronometer!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI don\u2019t care
    what it is!\u201D the woman cries. \u201CUse it!\u201D\r\n\tAt that moment flames
    shoot out of the opening in the wall. The dragon\u2019s huge, scaly face appears.
    Its evil yellow eyes narrow when it sees you.\r\n\tQuick! Make a decision! Should
    you try to use the chronometer as a key to rescue the woman? Or should you just
    get out of there as fast as you can?\r\n\tHurry! The dragon\u2019s about to breathe
    fire again!\n\n\tPress 1 to use the chronometer.\n\tPress 2 to run out of the
    room"
