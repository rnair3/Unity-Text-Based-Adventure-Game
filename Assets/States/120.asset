    you repeat. \u201CBut I\u2019m not a crew member, either. I\u2019m actually a
    time traveler.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CLikely story!\u201D the captain snarls. \u201CIf
    you\u2019re a time traveler, prove it!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThe device your guard

    She glances at it, then hands it back to you. You quickly slip it under your uniform
    in case she changes her mind.\r\n\t\u201CIf you are really from the past,\u201D

    not from that far back,\u201D you protest.\r\n\tShe sighs. \u201COkay, while I
    decide what to do with you, wait outside.\u201D\r\n\tThe guards each take one
    of your arms and roughly shove you out into the corridor.\n\n\nPress 1 to continue"
