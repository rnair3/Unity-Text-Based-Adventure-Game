  storyText: "\tDenny loves dinosaurs. You decide to explore the swamp where you saw
    the dinosaur. You\u2019re sure Denny went that way.\r\n\tAs you move toward the
    swamp, tall, fernlike vegetation surrounds you. Your feet sink into the thick,
    mucky water.\r\n\tThrough the trees you can see huge shapes moving about. Real
    dinosaurs! Cool! you think. This is just like Jurassic Park \u2014 only better!\r\n\tThe
    dinosaurs are red, blue, green, and lavender \u2014 as colorful as birds. Some
    dinosaurs are the size of dogs and cats. Other dinosaurs are bigger than a house.
    They\u2019re all munching on leaves and weeds.\r\n\tYou\u2019re about to move
    closer when a tremendous noise shakes the ground.\r\n\tThe trees sway as the rumbling
    grows louder. And louder. What\u2019s happening?\r\n\tYou peer through the giant
    ferns toward a grassy plain. Your eyes grow wide. You can\u2019t believe it. Lumbering
    toward you is \u2014 a Tyrannosaurus rex!\n\n\tPress 1 if you dare to go on."
