  storyText: "\t\u201CI\u2019m ready to begin the duel,\u201D the knight tells you.
    He plucks an apple from the tree. Then he winds up and throws the apple toward
    you. Holding the club like a baseball bat, you smack the apple. It soars down
    the path, past the knight.\r\n\t\u201CI can hit it much farther,\u201D the knight
    boasts. He takes his place at the end of the drawbridge.\r\n\tNow you pick an
    apple from the tree. You stand on the pitcher\u2019s mound and eye the knight.
    Then you wind up. You pitch.\r\n\tThe knight swings with all his might.\r\n\tAnd
    hits a blooper a few feet in front of you.\r\n\tAll right!\r\n\t\u201CI won,\u201D
    you call. \u201CNow can I go into the castle? I need to look for my brother.\u201D\r\n\tThe
    knight nods. \u201CVery well, stranger,\u201D he says sadly. \u201CYou may enter
    the castle. But according to the rules, I must jump into the moat.\u201D\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to continue."
