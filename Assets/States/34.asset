  storyText: "\tYou\u2019ve got to stop the truck \u2014 that\u2019s the only way
    to save your family. Quickly you push the button on the chronometer. But a moment
    later you\u2019re on the same New York City street.\r\n\tUh-oh. Maybe the chronometer
    didn\u2019t work!\r\n\tThen you notice a tall billboard with a digital clock and
    calendar. It\u2019s the same day, all right, but an hour earlier.\r\n\tWhew. For
    now your family is safe. But you have to track down the truck and make sure nothing
    happens.\r\n\tYou remember seeing HERRING BROS. DELIVERIES on the truck\u2019s
    side panel. Quickly you look up the number and address in a phone book. Herring
    Bros. is only a few blocks away.\n\n\tWhat are you waiting for? You only have
    an hour. Press 1."
