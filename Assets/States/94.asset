  storyText: "\tQuickly, you pull the chronometer from around your neck and put it
    in the keyhole.\r\n\t\u201CRRAAAOOORRRGGGHHH!\u201D the dragon bellows, filling
    the small room with flames and more smoke.\r\n\tThe woman shrieks in terror. You
    turn the chronometer in the lock. To your surprise, the lock pops open. The woman
    quickly pulls off her chains, then grabs your hand. \u201CThis way!\u201D she
    cries. \u201CThe dragon can\u2019t follow!\u201D\r\n\tShe leads you through a
    small door and slams it. Behind the door, the dragon roars angrily.\r\n\t\u201CThank
    you for saving me,\u201D the woman says. \u201CIs there any way I can repay you?\u201D\r\n\tYou
    explain that you\u2019re looking for your brother. \u201CHe has red hair,\u201D
    you say, describing him.\r\n\tThe woman nods. \u201CI\u2019ve seen a young boy
    who looks just like that in the Throne Room.\u201D She points to a door labeled
    TO KING RUTHBERT\u2019S THRONE ROOM.\r\n\tYou glance at the chronometer. Time
    is running out! You\u2019ve got only half an hour to find Denny and return to
    the present.\r\n\t\u201CGood luck.\u201D The woman smiles. \u201CAnd thanks again.\u201D\n\n\n\tPress
