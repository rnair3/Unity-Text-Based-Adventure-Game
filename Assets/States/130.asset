    born. You\u2019ll catch up with Denny in a few minutes.\r\n\tYou keep your eyes
    on the big speckled egg.\r\n\tThis is too cool, you think. Maybe it\u2019s a brachiosaurus
    or a triceratops. You\u2019ve always wanted to see one of them.\r\n\tTap. Tap.
    Tap.\r\n\tThe baby dinosaur struggles to get out.\r\n\tCRACK! The enormous egg
    splits open.\r\n\tYou lean forward \u2014 you\u2019re dying to see this!\r\n\tThen
    out it pops. You see a long tail \u2026 a tiny beak \u2026 and soft wet feathers.\r\n\tFEATHERS?\r\n\tYou
    can\u2019t believe it. This baby\u2019s not a dinosaur. It\u2019s a chicken.\r\n\tSome
    kind of weird, prehistoric chicken!\r\n\tOkay. Now you\u2019ve learned your lesson.\r\n\tNever
    count your dinosaurs before they hatch!\n\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
