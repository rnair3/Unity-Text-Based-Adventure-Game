  storyText: "\tYou reach into the pool of quicksand and feel around for the chronometer.
    Suddenly, the ground begins to shake violently. Under your feet the earth sways,
    and a deafening rumble fills the air.\r\n\t\u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D you
    yell to Denny. Smoke pours out of the top of a nearby mountain.\r\n\t\u201CA volcano!\u201D
    you shout.\r\n\tA second later, the top of the volcano blows off. Red-hot lava
    pours out. Even though the volcano is at least a half mile away, you can feel
    the heat against your skin. Large rocks, glowing white-hot, begin to land in the
    swamp like bombs. \u201CWatch out!\u201D Denny shrieks. \u201CDuck!\u201D\r\n\tYou
    cover your head and throw yourself on the ground.\r\n\tWhoomp! A rock just misses
    you. It splashes into the mud and throws up a shower of mud and water and \u2014
    something shiny.\r\n\tCould it be? Yes, it\u2019s the chronometer!\r\n\tQuickly,
    you crawl over and scoop it up. It\u2019s covered with mud. Desperately, you feel
    for the buttons on the side of the chronometer. Your fingers close on two of them.\n\n\tPress
    1 to press the buttons"
