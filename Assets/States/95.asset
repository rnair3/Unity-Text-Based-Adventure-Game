  storyText: "\tYou yank your hand away from the lion. To your surprise, it lets you
    go. But just as you are about to press the buttons on the chronometer, the lion
    pounces on your brother, knocking you both over.\r\n\tThe chronometer flies out
    of your hand. At the same moment, there\u2019s a loud pop! Denny disappears into
    the air. With a squeak of surprise, the lion disappears, too!\r\n\tYou look all
    around, but there\u2019s no sign of either your brother or the beast. And the
    chronometer lies smashed on the floor.\r\n\tOh, no! Now you\u2019ve done it. Maybe
    the wizard can help you.\r\n\tYou wander back through the castle, trying to find
    the wizard\u2019s lair. At last you come to the door labeled: LAIR OF THE WIZARD.\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to see the wizard"
