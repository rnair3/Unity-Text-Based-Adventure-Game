  storyText: "\t\u201CI choose school,\u201D you tell the judge.\r\n\tThe robot policeman
    drags you off to another room in the same building. You are surprised to see that
    it\u2019s a regular classroom with wooden desks, a blackboard, and a computer
    center. There is also a metal box the size of a closet standing in the front of
    the room.\r\n\tThe desks are all filled with human students about your age.\r\n\t\u201CWe
    will continue the quiz now,\u201D the teacher says in a hollow voice. \u201CAnita,
    what is the capital of Ulan Bator?\u201D\r\n\tA girl stands nervously. \u201CI

    frammilizer,\u201D the teacher says.\r\n\tThe girl bites her fingernails as she
    goes to the front of the room. She climbs into the metal box. The teacher slams
    the door shut and presses a button. The box hums, then glows bright green. When
    the door springs open, you gasp out loud.\n\n\tPress 1 to continue...."
