    got to create a distraction.\r\n\tYou glance at the newsstand again, and an idea
    comes to you. It\u2019s not much \u2014 but it\u2019s the only thing you can think

    \u2014 your allowance, plus some money your dad gave you to buy souvenirs.\r\n\tYou
    ask the newsstand owner for change. You get a bunch of bills and coins. Suddenly

    he doing here, too?\r\n\t\u201CDenny!\u201D you shout. \u201CWhat are you doing
    here?\u201D\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
