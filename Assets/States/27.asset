  storyText: "\t\u201CWait!\u201D you shout to the driver. \u201CI\u2019ve changed
    my mind!\u201D\r\n\tBut it\u2019s too late. The driver can\u2019t hear you. With
    a lurch, the truck starts off.\r\n\tThe truck bumps along the city streets. Outside,
    you can hear honking horns and the engines of other trucks and cars. You\u2019re
    stuck back here with hundreds of dead fish \u2014 how are you going to save your
    family now?\r\n\tYou stand up and squeeze between the crates of fish. You make
    your way toward the driver\u2019s cab. You pound on the area behind the driver,
    trying to get his attention.\r\n\tBut the truck keeps going.\r\n\tAnd starts to
    pick up speed! It swerves wildly, and outside you can hear honking horns and angry
    shouting.\r\n\tThe truck\u2019s out of control!\r\n\tAnd you\u2019re stuck inside
    it!\r\n\tIt\u2019s too late to stop the truck this time. All you can do now is
    press the button on the chronometer, return to the past, and try something else.\n\n\tPress
    1 to return to the past."
