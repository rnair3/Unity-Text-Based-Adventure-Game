  storyText: "\t\u201CExcuse me,\u201D you say, walking over to the truck driver.
    \u201CThe dispatcher asked if you could take me on your delivery. My uncle owns
    the store you\u2019re delivering to, and I need a ride there.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSure,
    kid,\u201D he says. \u201CWhy not?\u201D\r\n\tYou follow him to the green truck.
    He opens the back. Cases of fresh fish are piled inside. The dead fish stare at
    you with cold, empty eyes.\r\n\t\u201CHop in,\u201D the driver says.\r\n\t\u201CIn
    there? B-but \u2026\u201D you stammer.\r\n\t\u201CThe cab\u2019s full,\u201D he
    says. \u201CDo you want a ride or not?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CUh \u2026\u201D You really
    need to be in the front with him. But you don\u2019t know what else to do, so
    you climb into the back of the truck and sit down.\r\n\tWhen the driver shuts
    the door, everything goes dark. You can\u2019t believe how bad it smells back
    here. And the fishes\u2019 cold, scaly bodies keep brushing against you.\r\n\tYuck!\n\n\n\tHold
    your nose and press 1"
