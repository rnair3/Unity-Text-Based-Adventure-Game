  storyText: "\tYou step between the bookcases and find yourself in a small, dark
    cave filled with piles of straw. The air is damp and smells terrible.\r\n\tIn
    one corner there\u2019s a dent in the straw, as if a very large animal has been
    lying there. Next to the dent is a pile of bones with teeth marks in them.\r\n\t\u201CDenny?\u201D
    you call nervously. \u201CDenny, are you in here?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHelp me!\u201D
    A sudden, faint voice fills the cave. It\u2019s your brother. \u201CHelp me!\u201D
    he cries again.\r\n\tThe voice seems to be coming from the back of the little
    cave. You crawl farther back and see several piles of straw and a small opening.
    You press your eye up to the opening and peer inside. In the darkness, several
    tiny red lights glow.\r\n\t\u201CHelp!\u201D Denny\u2019s voice sounds fainter
    and more terrified.\r\n\tBut where is he? Is he hiding behind one of the piles
    of straw? Or did he go through the opening?\r\n\tMake a decision quickly. Time
    is running out!\n\n\n\tIf you crawl through the opening with the red lights, press
    1.\r\n\tIf you stay in the cave, press 2."
