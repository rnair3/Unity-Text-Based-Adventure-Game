  storyText: "\t\u201CReady for what?\u201D you ask.\r\n\t\u201CWhy, to travel in
    time, of course,\u201D he replies. \u201CYou\u2019ll be the first human in history
    to use my traveling chronometer.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CChronometer?\u201D you echo.
    \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D\r\n\tHe points to the stopwatch around your neck.\r\n\t\u201CI
    don\u2019t have time \u2014\u201D you start to say, but he interrupts again.\r\n\t\u201COf
    course you have time!\u201D Dr. Peebles goes on. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter
    how long you remain in the past or future. When you return to the present, it
    will be the same moment that you left. It will be as if you weren\u2019t gone
    at all.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHow does this work?\u201D you ask, pointing to the stopwatch.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    easy,\u201D says Dr. Peebles. \u201CPress the button on the left side to travel
    to the past. Press the button on the right for the future. To return to the present,
    press the top button and the bottom button at the same time.\u201D\r\n\tCool!
    you think. What if this guy\u2019s invention really works? Traveling in time would
    be awesome!\r\n\t\u201CThere\u2019s no time to waste!\u201D Dr. Peebles says.
    \u201CI\u2019m ready to begin the experiment now.\u201D\n\n\tHurry!!! Press 1
    to continue...."
