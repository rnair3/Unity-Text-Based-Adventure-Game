  storyText: "\tA hideous lion stands at the entrance to the cave. It\u2019s enormous
    \u2014 bigger than any lion you\u2019ve seen at the zoo. Its head is covered with
    yellow-brown fur and a thick mane. Its eyes glitter as it looks you up and down.\r\n\tThen
    you recognize the beast.\r\n\tIt\u2019s the lion from the tapestry in the entranceway
    to the castle!\r\n\tIn terror, Denny ducks behind you.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019ll
    do just as well!\u201D the creature snarls as it rushes toward you. It grabs you
    by the arm, licking its lips hungrily.\r\n\tYou glance at the chronometer in your
    hand. The lion is touching you, so if you press the chronometer buttons now it
    will travel to the future with you and Denny. But if you don\u2019t go to the
    present soon, you and Denny will be lost forever.\r\n\tShould you stay here? Or
    return to Dr. Peebles\u2019s laboratory with both Denny and the lion?\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to escape now.\n\tPress 2 to stay and fight the lion."
