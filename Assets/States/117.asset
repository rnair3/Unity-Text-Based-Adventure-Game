    find Denny. You race out of the smoky room.\r\n\t\u201CHalt!\u201D the woman screams.
    \u201CYou\u2019ve failed the knight test!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    not really a helpless maiden,\u201D the woman explains. She breaks free of the
    chains holding her to the wall. \u201CI\u2019m actually the dragon\u2019s keeper.
    This is a test we set up for future knights. Anyone who refuses to try to rescue
    the maiden fails.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CBut I don\u2019t want to be a knight!\u201D
    you protest.\r\n\t\u201COf course you do,\u201D says the maiden. \u201COtherwise,
    why would you be in this room?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m looking for my brother
    \u2014\u201D you start to say, but it\u2019s no use.\r\n\tThe maiden snaps her
    finger, and the dragon slithers into the room toward you!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
