  storyText: "\tYou decide to go toward the futuristic city. All around you are buildings
    made of shiny metal and glass. Cars \u2014 with wings \u2014 fly above your head.
    The streets are empty and clean, with no litter \u2014 not even a gum wrapper.\r\n\tIs
    this New York in the future? It certainly looks different from the one you\u2019re
    visiting in the present.\r\n\tYou\u2019re about to start looking for Denny when
    a hand closes on your shoulder in an icy grip.\r\n\t\u201CHuman?\u201D a hollow-sounding
    voice says. \u201CYou\u2019re under arrest!\u201D\r\n\tYou whirl around. Gripping
    your shoulder is a shiny metal robot with a policeman\u2019s badge welded to its
    chest. The robot\u2019s face is expressionless, and it\u2019s holding something
    that looks like a laser gun. No wonder everything is so clean and quiet, you think.
    The city is run by machines!\r\n\t\u201CDon\u2019t you know that humans aren\u2019t
    allowed out in the streets?\u201D the robot demands.\r\n\t\u201CI come from \u2026
    another place,\u201D you quickly reply. \u201CI don\u2019t know your rules. Please
    give me another chance.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThat\u2019s for the judge to decide,\u201D
    the robot says. \u201CCome with me.\u201D\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
