  storyText: "\tYou step up to the wizard\u2019s door, take a deep breath, and pull
    it open. Inside is a dim, smoky room. It\u2019s filled with a jumble of books,
    tables, pots of boiling liquid, crystal balls, and other strange magical equipment.\r\n\t\u201CHello!\u201D
    you call. \u201CDenny? Is anyone here?\u201D\r\n\tThe only answer is a rustling
    sound behind you.\r\n\t\u201CDenny?\u201D you shout, whirling around.\r\n\tYou
    gasp when you see what\u2019s there.\r\n\tCrouched on a pile of rags behind the
    table is the biggest lizard you\u2019ve ever seen. Around its neck is an iron
    collar with a name tag that reads \u2026 WIZARD!\r\n\tA lizard named Wizard?\r\n\tThe
    lizard\u2019s cold black eyes gaze at you. Its narrow tongue flicks in and out.
    You take a step backward.\r\n\tAs the reptile starts toward you, you recognize
    the pile of rags it was sitting on \u2014 Denny\u2019s clothes!\r\n\tYou swallow
    hard. Now you know what happened to your brother\u2026.\r\n\tAnd what will happen
    to you!\n\n\tPress 1 to continue..."
