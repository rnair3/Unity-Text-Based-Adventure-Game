  storyText: "\tHerring Bros. is a big garage on the ground floor of a large high-rise
    building. You step inside. There are just a few trucks. The only green one is
    easy to spot by the far wall.\r\n\tIn a booth by another wall, a woman with a
    microphone and headset sits behind a glass window. She\u2019s the dispatcher for
    the delivery firm. Maybe you can stop her from sending out the truck. Or would
    it be better to talk to the truck driver himself?\n\n\tPress 1 to speak to the
    dispatcher.\r\n\tPress 2 to talk to the driver."
