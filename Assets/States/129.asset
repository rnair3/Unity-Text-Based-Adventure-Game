  storyText: "\tAll right! The robot fell for it!\r\n\tYou can see yourself stepping
    into the Chronoport. Then you hear Dr. Peebles say: \u201COne more thing! Remember
    to hold the buttons down for at least five seconds!\u201D\r\n\tThat\u2019s exactly
    what you needed to hear. Now you know how to make the chronometer work! But you
    still can\u2019t find Denny.\r\n\t\u201CI don\u2019t believe your Teletime machine
    really shows the past,\u201D you say.\r\n\t\u201CWhat!!??\u201D the robot roars.
    \u201CHow dare you insult my machine!\u201D Its finger moves closer to the trigger.\r\n\t\u201CIf
    it really works,\u201D you say quickly, \u201Cthen show me the present.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThe
    present?\u201D the robot cries.\r\n\t\u201CYes!\u201D You nod. \u201CThe scenes
    from the past could have been films or videotapes. If I see scenes from the present,
    I\u2019ll believe the machine really works.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CVery well,\u201D
    the robot grumbles. \u201CBut right afterward I will take pleasure in vaporizing
    you. Any particular scene in the present?\u201D it adds sarcastically.\r\n\tYou
    smile. Your plan is working.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
