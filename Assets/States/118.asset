    come to a large platform guarded by a robot.\r\n\t\u201CHalt, human!\u201D it
    demands. \u201CWhat is your business here?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m here to fix
    the romiframpton,\u201D you tell the robot.\r\n\t\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with
    it?\u201D the robot demands.\r\n\tYou think quickly, then say the first thing
    that comes to your mind. \u201CThe snazzilizer is pulsing out of phase.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo

    mind the romiframpton,\u201D the robot says. \u201CNow that we know what\u2019s
    wrong, we can fix it ourselves. But with your mechanical genius we can use you
    as an instructor in the electronics college. Come with me.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo,\u201D
    you protest. \u201CI need to \u2014\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI said, come with me!\u201D
    the robot repeats in a nasty metallic twang.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to go to college"
