  storyText: "\tYou think for a moment. Dr. Peebles obviously believes you\u2019re
    someone else. But a trip through time sounds like a lot of fun. More fun than
    staring at crummy old bowls all day. And since you\u2019ll return at the exact
    same time you left, you\u2019ll still be able to find Denny and return to your
    parents before they know anything is wrong.\r\n\tOn the other hand, Denny can
    get into a lot of trouble very fast. And your parents will blame you if anything
    happens.\r\n\tMake a decision now. Do you want to travel in time? Or should you
    look for your brother first?\n\n\tWhat do you want to do next???\n\tPress 1 to
    volunteer for Dr. Peeble's experiment.\n\tPress 2 to stay and find Denny"
