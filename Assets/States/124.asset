  storyText: "\tYou ask someone to point out the driver of the green truck. He\u2019s
    a gray-haired man in a plaid jacket.\r\n\tNow you have to decide what to say to
    him. Maybe you can get him to take you along with him, and then, at the crucial
    moment, you can steer the truck away from your family.\r\n\tFinally, you come
    up with two plans. You could tell him you\u2019re from out of town and you\u2019re
    lost, and you want a ride to your hotel. Or you could pretend the dispatcher wants
    him to take you along on the next delivery.\r\n\tWhich will you choose?\n\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to tell the driver you\u2019re lost.\r\n\tPress 2 to petend the dispatcher sent
    you."
