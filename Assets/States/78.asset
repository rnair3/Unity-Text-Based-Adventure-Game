    on your arm.\r\n\tYou can\u2019t help it. You punch him back. \u201CDon\u2019t
    be a jerk!\u201D you say. \u201CTurn around now! If you don\u2019t, something
    terrible will happen!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re not the boss of me!\u201D Denny
    yells. He rushes toward the intersection.\r\n\t\u201CStop!\u201D you yell again.
    Denny turns around and kicks you, hard, in the shin. You are so mad you grab him
    in a headlock. \u201CSay you\u2019re sorry!\u201D you yell.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re
    not the boss of me!\u201D Denny screams again.\r\n\tThis time the other you jumps
    into the fight. While you hold on to Denny\u2019s neck, the you from the future
    pokes him in the chest.\r\n\t\u201CSay you\u2019re sorry,\u201D you demand, tightening
    your hold on his neck. \u201CSay it.\u201D\r\n\tThis time you don\u2019t even
    see the truck bearing down on you and your family. It\u2019s too much fun having
    two of you to gang up on Denny!\n\n\tPress 1 to continue."
