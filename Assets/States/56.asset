  storyText: "\tYou decide your best chance for escape \u2014 and for finding Denny
    \u2014 is to go to the past.\r\n\tThe teacher finishes questioning the girl in
    front of you. Before the robot gets to you, you press the left-hand button on
    the chronometer. You feel a tingling sensation, and the classroom disappears.\r\n\tThe
    next thing you know, you are standing on a familiar-looking sidewalk. Across the
    street, a robot strolls along, looking in shop windows.\r\n\tIs this the past?
    This is the same spot where the robot policeman picked you up!\r\n\tBut it\u2019s
    nighttime now, you realize a minute later. You\u2019ve traveled to the past, just
    not very far back.\r\n\tYou hear approaching footsteps and quickly duck into a
    doorway. You stay very, very still.\r\n\tThen you feel a hand come down, hard,
    on your shoulder.\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
