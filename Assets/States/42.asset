  storyText: "\tYou push open the door and step into the power room. You can feel
    the hot green glow from the power source on your skin. You place the red box next
    to the glowing orb and get ready to run.\r\n\tJust as you reach the door, it slams
    shut!\r\n\tOh, no. It\u2019s locked!\r\n\tThrough a window you can see a robot
    guard on the other side. It\u2019s laughing at you!\r\n\tDesperately you reach
    for the chronometer. But the device turns white-hot and starts to melt in your
    hands! Somehow the pulsing glow is destroying it!\r\n\tYou push and pull on the
    door again, but it won\u2019t budge.\r\n\tThe explosive device is programmed to
    go off within one minute. That minute is nearly up. Maybe the rebels will be able
    to help \u2014\r\n\tBOOM!!!\r\n\tMaybe not \u2026\n\n\tPress 1 to continue."
