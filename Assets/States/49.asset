    Jarmal said you\u2019d have one minute to escape from the power plant. That\u2019s
    not enough time to make it down the ladder! Then you spot a small door behind
    the ladder, labeled EMERGENCY EXIT.\r\n\t\tYou throw yourself toward the exit.
    You\u2019re in a slick chute that leads down. You slide toward the bottom, holding
    your breath. Will you make it before the plant blows?\n\n\tPress 1 to continue."
