    sign in front of the force field. \u201CIt\u2019s the \u2018Couch Potato\u2019
    exhibit,\u201D the small robot goes on. It begins making strange noises again.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    not polite to laugh at the humans,\u201D one of the bigger robots says.\r\n\t\u201CBut,
    Mommy,\u201D replies the little one. \u201CIt\u2019s so funny-looking. Here, human!\u201D
    it adds. It shoves something through the force field. You lean down to pick up
    a candy bar.\r\n\t\u201CLook!\u201D says the little one. \u201CIt picked up the
    candy! It\u2019s eating it!\u201D The small robot pushes another candy bar through
    the force field.\r\n\tWith a sinking feeling, you realize that you\u2019re stuck
    here for good. But cheer up. At least when the little robots visit, you\u2019ll
    get to eat plenty of candy.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
