  storyText: "\tAs you reach for a weapon, you notice an apple tree planted alongside
    the moat. Suddenly you have an idea \u2014 and it\u2019s just what you need to
    put a chink in this knight\u2019s armor.\r\n\t\u201CI choose the club,\u201D you
    tell the knight. \u201CBut we\u2019ll duel according to my rules.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CVery
    well, stranger,\u201D the knight says. He hands you the club.\r\n\t\u201CSee that
    apple tree?\u201D you say. \u201CPick one of the apples and toss it toward me.
    I\u2019ll hit the apple with the club. Then I\u2019ll throw an apple for you to
    hit. Whoever hits the apple farthest will win the duel.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CA strange
    challenge indeed,\u201D the knight grumbles. \u201CBut I accept.\u201D\r\n\tLast
    year you were the best batter on your baseball team. Now you\u2019re hoping your
    batting average will pay off. Can you beat the knight at baseball? To find out,
    flip two coins.\n\n\r\n\tPress 1 if both coins come up the same, heads or tails.\r\n\tPress
    2 if one coin comes up heads and the other comes up tails."
