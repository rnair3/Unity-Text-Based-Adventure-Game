  storyText: "\tYou decide to try to trick the robot guards. You glance at the chronometer.
    Less than an hour left to find Denny and return to the present.\r\n\t\u201CWhen
    you get to the guards,\u201D Jarmal says, \u201Ctell them you have been sent to
    fix the romiframpton.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D you ask.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s
    the central processor for the plant,\u201D Jarmal says. \u201CEither the guard
    will believe you and let you through \u2014 or he will vaporize you on the spot.\u201D\r\n\tOh
    great, you think. No wonder no one else volunteered for this job. Jarmal gives
    you a pair of white coveralls to put on. You stick the red box in your pocket.
    \u201CGood luck,\u201D he tells you.\r\n\tYou take a deep breath and approach
    the entrance to the power plant. A big metal robot with a laser gun stops you.
    \u201CWhat do you want, human?\u201D it demands.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m here to fix
    the romiframpton,\u201D you say.\r\n\tThe robot hesitates. \u201CWe\u2019ve received
    no report that it was broken.\u201D Your stomach lurches. Are you going to be
    vaporized?\n\n\tQuick! Press 1.."
