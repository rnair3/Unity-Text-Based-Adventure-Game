  storyText: "\tYou step through the door labeled TO THE LAIR. You find yourself in
    a very narrow passageway.\r\n\tSmoking candles along the walls give off a little
    light as the path twists and turns. You\u2019re beginning to wonder if you made
    the wrong choice when you see something on the path:\r\n\tA squashed Gummi Bear.\r\n\tYour
    heart stops. There were no Gummi Bears in medieval times. Denny\u2019s been here!\r\n\tYou
    hurry along the corridor and see more squashed Gummi Bears. Your brother has definitely
    come this way. But where is he now?\r\n\tYou come to a narrow staircase. You follow
    the cold stone steps downward. At the bottom is a big wooden door. Over it, a
    sign says LAIR OF THE WIZARD.\r\n\tNext to that door is a tiny door about a foot
    high. The sign over the small door says LAIR OF THE LIZARD.\r\n\tYou think again
    about the knight\u2019s last words to you: \u201CBeware of the Lair.\u201D But
    which lair did he mean?\n\n\tPress 1 to approach the Lair of the Wizard.\r\n\tPress
    2 to check out the Lair of the Lizard."
