    The doors glide open. You walk off the shuttle and enter a corridor.\r\n\tInside
    the space station, robots and humans hurry along the walkway. Denny might be here
    somewhere \u2014 but where?\r\n\tA pair of robots wearing security badges stare
    right at you. All the other humans are wearing bright yellow uniforms, you notice.

    sits on a shelf.\n\n\n\tPut on the uniform and press 1."
