    The only person who can help you find Denny is Dr. Peebles. You pull the chronometer
    from under your uniform and press the top and bottom buttons to return to his
    laboratory. You\u2019ve got to escape before anyone \u2014 or anything \u2014
    comes after you again.\r\n\tBut nothing happens.\r\n\tYou press the buttons again,
    and nothing happens.\r\n\tOh, no.\r\n\tWhat will you do now? You glance up and
    notice the sign pointing to TELETIME. Maybe it has something to do with time travel.
    Maybe there\u2019s another way to get back to the present.\n\n\tPress 1 to enter
