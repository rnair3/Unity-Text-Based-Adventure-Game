    In fact, he seems to have fainted!\r\n\tYou struggle out of your seat belt. It\u2019s
    up to you to do something!\r\n\tThis is what you planned for.\r\n\tThis is why
    you came back to this time. But somehow you didn\u2019t think it would be so hard
    to stop the truck.\r\n\tMaybe you can steer the truck onto another street. Or
    should you try to reach the brakes?\r\n\tMake a decision quick!\n\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to try to steer the truck?\r\n\tPress 2 to go for the brakes?"
