  storyText: "\tYou follow the purple sign and rush into the Engine Room area. It\u2019s
    crammed with machinery and monitor screens. At the center is a control panel with
    banks of blinking lights. Next to the control panel is a clear plastic chamber,
    about the size of a car, labeled ANTIGRAV.\r\n\tInside the chamber is a small
    figure that\u2019s floating and turning in midair.\r\n\tIt\u2019s Denny! You yank
    open the door. \u201CDenny!\u201D you call. \u201CWe\u2019ve got to get back to
    the present right now!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI don\u2019t want to,\u201D he whines.\r\n\tYou
    step into the chamber, but your feet don\u2019t touch the floor. There\u2019s
    no gravity here \u2014 you\u2019re weightless! You get a funny feeling in your
    stomach as you start to float around.\r\n\tYou grab for your brother \u2014 but
    he easily twists away. You find yourself upside down. If you weren\u2019t so worried
    about returning to your own time, this would be fun. \u201CCome on, Denny!\u201D
    you beg.\r\n\t\u201CYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201D He sneers at you.\r\n\tYou
    grab for him again \u2014 and miss. Then you glance outside the chamber \u2014
    a robot guard has his laser gun pointed straight at you.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue."
