  storyText: "\tSomehow you\u2019ve got to talk Denny into coming back to the present
    with you. But how?\r\n\tThen you get an idea. \u201CDenny,\u201D you say very
    calmly. \u201CI\u2019m going back to Dr. Peebles\u2019s laboratory now. But I
    don\u2019t want you to come with me.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhy not?\u201D Denny asks
    suspiciously.\r\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201D you say as nastily
    as you can. \u201CYou can come back later today \u2014 or tomorrow.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo!\u201D
    Denny whines. \u201CI want to go back now.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWell, you can\u2019t,\u201D
    you say. \u201CI\u2019m going without you.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNOOOO!\u201D he whines
    louder. \u201CTake me with you!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CSorry.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019ll
    tell Mom!\u201D he insists. \u201CI\u2019ll tell her how you\u2019re always trying
    to be the boss of me.\u201D\r\n\t\u201COh, all right,\u201D you say, trying to
    sound disgusted. \u201CHold my hand, then.\u201D Looking pleased, Denny takes
    your hand. You glance down at the chronometer. Forty-five seconds \u2014 plenty
    of time to spare. And Denny doesn\u2019t even realize that he tricked himself!\n\n\n\n\tPress
