    you want help finding your brother,\u201D Jarmal snaps, \u201Cyou\u2019d better
    do it.\u201D\r\n\tFinally you agree. What else can you do?\r\n\tJarmal hands you
    the red box with the explosives. \u201CRemember, you have to place it within three
    feet of the power source. And one more thing \u2026 you have only one minute to
    get away before it blows.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CHow am I supposed to get into the building?\u201D
    you ask.\r\n\t\u201CThere are two ways to get in,\u201D Jarmal tells you. \u201COne
    is to find some way to get past the robot guards at the door.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo
    thanks,\u201D you mutter. \u201CWhat\u2019s the other way?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CYou
    could crawl in through the air duct,\u201D Jarmal says. \u201CThat way you\u2019ll
    avoid the robots \u2014 but the ducts are very narrow. Crawling through them could
    be very, very dangerous.\u201D\r\n\tHow will you enter the building?\r\n\tDecide
    carefully \u2014 the fate of humans on Earth may depend on your answer!\n\n\n\tPress
    1 to try to fool the guards?.\r\n\tPress to crawl in through the air duct?."
