  storyText: "\tYou love the zoo! What a weird punishment, you think, as the police
    robot takes you away in a flying car.\r\n\tSoon you zoom through the zoo gates.
    Giraffes, elephants, tigers, and antelopes roam around the grounds. Instead of
    bars, a shimmering transparent force field separates the animals from the viewers.\r\n\t\u201CYou
    will remain here,\u201D the robot announces, stopping in front of an exhibit that
    looks like a living room, with a couch, chairs, and a TV.\r\n\tThe robot yanks
    the chronometer off your neck.\r\n\t\u201CGive that back!\u201D you shout, but
    the robot ignores you. It aims its laser gun at the force field around the exhibit.
    The field dissolves, and the robot pushes you into the exhibit.\r\n\t\u201CWait
    a minute!\u201D you protest. \u201CYou can\u2019t leave me here!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    sure you will be comfortable,\u201D the robot tells you. It zaps its gun again,
    and the force field goes back up.\r\n\t\u201CNo!\u201D you cry, trying to push
    through the force field.\r\n\tThen a group of robots approaches. Two little ones
    point and make strange coughing noises.\r\n\tWhat are they pointing at?\n\n\tPress
    1 to find out."
