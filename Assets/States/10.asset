    of machines over people will end! Are you with us or against us?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWell,
    I \u2014\u201D Your words are drowned out by more explosions. The men and women
    around you have grabbed weapons and are racing down the tunnel.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m
    against the robots!\u201D you shout to Jarmal. \u201CBut I have to find my brother!
    If I don\u2019t get back to the present, we\u2019ll both be stuck somewhere in
    time.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CThat\u2019s not my problem!\u201D Jarmal snaps.\r\n\tYou
    turn away from him.\r\n\t\u201CWe saw a child a day ago,\u201D Jarmal says in
    a softer tone. \u201CPerhaps he was your brother. But he ran off and hid from
    us. I promise we\u2019ll help you find him \u2014 but only after you\u2019ve joined
    us in fighting the robots. Do you agree \u2014 or not?\u201D\r\n\tThink it over
    carefully. You have only an hour till your time runs out. Can you trust Jarmal
    to help you find Denny? Or should you go back up to the streets now and look for
    Denny there?\n\n\tPress 1 to join the rebel.\n\tPress 2 to search for Denny\n"
