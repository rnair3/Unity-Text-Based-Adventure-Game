  storyText: "\tYou crawl through the small opening. In the darkness the red lights
    glitter like jewels.\r\n\tSticky, ropelike strands hang from the walls and ceiling.
    At the end of each strand there\u2019s a big gray lump.\r\n\tYou move closer to
    the strands and shudder.\r\n\tThe strands are part of a big spiderweb! And the
    big gray lumps are the bodies of giant insects!\r\n\t\u201CHelp me!\u201D a voice
    cries out.\r\n\tAs you stare at the web you realize one of the wrapped-up insects
    is much larger than the others.\r\n\t\u201CHelp me!\u201D\r\n\tIt\u2019s Denny!
    A giant spider has wrapped him up in its silk!\n\n\n\tQuick! Press 1"
