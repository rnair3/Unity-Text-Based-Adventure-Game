  storyText: "\tThe squealing of brakes fills the air. The truck lurches to a stop
    right before your family.\r\n\tCRASH!\r\n\tA taxicab slams into the back of the
    truck. Horns blare and several drivers jump from their cars as a horrible stench
    fills the air.\r\n\tWhat\u2019s going on?\r\n\tYou leap out of the truck and run
    around to the back. Luckily, the driver of the taxi is fine, but the truck\u2019s
    back doors have been smashed in. And now a river of dead, slippery fish is flowing
    out of the back, onto the taxicab\u2019s hood, and into the street.\r\n\tP.U.!\r\n\tYou
    grab the chronometer and push down on the buttons.\r\n\tYou\u2019re sorry about
    leaving Denny behind in the future, but, as he always says \u2014 you\u2019re
    not the boss of him.\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
