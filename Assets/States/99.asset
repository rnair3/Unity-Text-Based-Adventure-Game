  storyText: "\tYou\u2019re sure you can trick the robot. After all, you\u2019re human
    and he\u2019s just a machine.\r\n\t\u201CPlease don\u2019t shoot me,\u201D you
    cry. \u201CI\u2019m a visitor from the past. I\u2019m only here to find my brother.\u201D\r\n\tThe
    robot hesitates. It seems to be computing what you just said. Then it pulls back
    the trigger on its laser.\r\n\t\u201CI could prove it if you had better technology,\u201D
    you add.\r\n\tThe robot\u2019s electronic eye flashes angrily. \u201COur technology
    has been perfected,\u201D it states.\r\n\t\u201CToo bad.\u201D You heave a big
    sigh. \u201CI mean, you probably can\u2019t locate the time I left the present.\u201D\r\n\tThe
    robot scuttles over. \u201CWhen did you leave?\u201D it demands. \u201CI can find
    that!\u201D\r\n\tYou tell the robot the exact day and time that you left Dr. Peebles\u2019s
    laboratory.\r\n\tThe robot adjusts some controls. Then Dr. Peebles\u2019s laboratory
    appears on the large central monitor.\n\n\n\tPress 1 and watch what happens"
