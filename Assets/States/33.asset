  storyText: "\t\u201CCome with me.\u201D The wizard leads you to a large room filled
    with dusty bookcases and magical equipment. He seats himself at a table and stares
    into a crystal ball.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m thinking of a time-travel device,\u201D
    says the wizard. \u201CIt\u2019s a black cuckoo clock. A door in the center of
    the clock contains a mechanical bird.\u201D\r\n\tThe wizard\u2019s green eyes
    seem to give off sparks.\r\n\t\u201CHere is the question: How do you make time
    run backward? Do you pull the bird out of the door and put it back three times?
    Or do you twist its head around? Think carefully before you answer,\u201D he adds.
    \u201CIf you give a wrong answer you will be sent to the Corridors of Time \u2014
    forever.\u201D\r\n\tIf you\u2019ve read the GOOSEBUMPS book The Cuckoo Clock of
    Doom, you know the correct answer. If you haven\u2019t read that book, you\u2019ll
    have to guess how to make time run backward.\n\n\tDo you pull the bird out and
    put it back three times? If so, press 1.\r\n\tOr do you twist its head around?
    Press 2"
