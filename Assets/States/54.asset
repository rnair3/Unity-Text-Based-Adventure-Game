  storyText: "\tYou glide through the mist toward the New York City street where you
    saw the red-haired boy. Honking taxis, buses, and trucks zip along the street.
    Tall buildings surround you. On the streets, people are shouting, arguing, and
    laughing.\r\n\tUh-oh. This looks exactly like New York City in the present. Maybe
    something went wrong with the chronometer.\r\n\tYou glance around for the red-haired
    kid you saw. But you don\u2019t see him anywhere.\r\n\tYou approach a corner newsstand.
    \u201CExcuse me,\u201D you say to the vendor. \u201CCan you tell me how to get
    to the Museum of Natural History?\u201D\r\n\t\u201CWhat do I look like, an information
    booth?\u201D he snaps back at you.\r\n\t\u201CNever mind,\u201D you mutter. \u201CWho
    needs your \u2014\u201D\r\n\tThen you notice a stack of newspapers. The one on
    top has tomorrow\u2019s date. You\u2019re in the future all right \u2014 one crummy
    day in the future!\r\n\tNo fair! you think. You\u2019re about to push the right-hand
    button on the chronometer to travel further into the future when something makes
    you gasp.\n\n\tPress 1 to find out"
