  storyText: "\tYou\u2019ve got to find the chronometer. You stick your arm deep into
    the quicksand. You feel around with your fingers \u2026 nothing.\r\n\tSuddenly
    the Tyrannosaurus rex lets out a roar.\r\n\tYou plunge both hands into the quicksand.
    Beside you, Denny drops to his hands and knees to search, too.\r\n\tYou sift frantically
    through the mud. The dinosaur comes closer and closer. He reaches out one claw.
    Then he lets out a tremendous sound. It\u2019s a burp from his earlier feast \u2014
    a gigantic burp as loud as an explosion!\r\n\tThe force of the burp knocks both
    you and Denny over. The two of you pitch forward \u2026 right into the quicksand!\r\n\tOh,
    no! You\u2019re both being pulled down, down into the quivering muck, to meet
    \u2026\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
