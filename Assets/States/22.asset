  storyText: "\tIf only you\u2019d taken swimming lessons when your mom wanted you
    to! You decide not to jump into the moat. You face the knight and his spear.\r\n\tRight
    before he reaches you, the knight reins in his horse.\r\n\t\u201CWho are you,
    stranger?\u201D he demands.\r\n\t\u201CI\u2019m a visitor from the future. I\u2019m
    searching for my brother.\u201D\r\n\t\u201CNo one enters King Ruthbert\u2019s
    castle unless he can meet the challenge!\u201D he replies.\r\n\t\u201CWhat challenge?\u201D
    you ask.\r\n\t\u201CYou must fight me, his Noble Defender, in a duel,\u201D the
    knight says with a smirk. \u201CThe loser will become food for the king\u2019s
    crocodiles in the moat.\u201D\r\n\tCrocodiles in the moat? Good thing you didn\u2019t
    jump in after all!\r\n\tThe knight dismounts and pulls a bag of weapons from his
    saddle. You see a spear, a sword, a spiky chain, and a huge wooden club. \u201CHere,
    you may choose your weapon,\u201D he says.\r\n\tThis guy really wants to have
    a duel?\r\n\t\u201CWell,\u201D the knight says impatiently. \u201CChoose!\u201D\n\n\tChoose
    your weapon by pressing 1."
