  storyText: "\tYou press the button under your middle finger and immediately feel
    a tingling sensation. When it stops, you\u2019re standing near small trees. In
    the distance long-necked dinosaurs are grazing on some plants.\r\n\tDinosaurs!
    How far back in time have you gone? You don\u2019t have time to think about it
    when Denny says, \u201CLook at these weird rocks!\u201D\r\n\tDenny\u2019s standing
    next to six round, speckled boulders. They\u2019re not rocks, you realize. They\u2019re
    eggs. Dinosaur eggs! As you stare at the rocks, you hear a steady tapping sound.
    Then one of them begins to crack.\r\n\t\u201CWow!\u201D you cry. \u201CI think
    this egg\u2019s about to hatch!\u201D\r\n\t\u201CI want to do something else,\u201D
    Denny whines. \u201CI\u2019m bored.\u201D He grabs the chronometer and runs off.\r\n\t\u201CDenny,
    come back!\u201D you scream. But he keeps running.\r\n\tYou\u2019re going to have
    to go after him. But if you do, you\u2019ll miss the coolest thing that\u2019s
    happened since you got here. What should you do?\n\n\n\n\tPress 1 to watch the
    egg hatch.\r\n\tPress 2 to chase Denny."
