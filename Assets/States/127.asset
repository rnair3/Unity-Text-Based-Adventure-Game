  storyText: "\tYou decide to try to get back to Dr. Peebles\u2019s lab. But is there
    enough time?\r\n\tThe student in front of you has given a wrong answer.\r\n\t\u201CNo!\u201D
    the girl cries. \u201CGive me another chance!\u201D But the teacher shoves the
    student into the frammilizer. And now the robot\u2019s red electronic eye fixes
    on you.\r\n\t\u201CHow many electrons can be found in a pound of taffy?\u201D
    the teacher asks you.\r\n\tYou grasp the chronometer and place your fingers over
    the top and bottom buttons to return to Dr.Peebles\u2019s laboratory.\r\n\t\u201CAnswer!\u201D
    the robot thunders.\r\n\tYou quickly press the buttons.\r\n\tSPROIINNGGG! There
    is a hideous sound as the chronometer disintegrates in your hand. Tiny wheels
    and computer chips fly all over your desk.\r\n\t\u201CAnswer the question!\u201D
    the robot repeats.\r\n\tToo bad. There\u2019s no way you can return to your time.
    But cheer up \u2014 unless you know the answer to the question, you won\u2019t
    have to stay in the classroom very long!\n\n\n\tPress 1 to continue"
