  storyText: "\tYou reach the swamp and grab Denny\u2019s hands. With all your might,
    you pull. But Denny is completely stuck!\r\n\tYou pull Denny again. This time
    he panics. He grabs wildly at you. The chronometer flies off the chain around
    your neck and into the mud.\r\n\tNow the tyrannosaur is only a few yards away.
    Its terrible face is so close, you can see its sharp, pointed teeth and smell
    its hot, stinking breath. The dinosaur roars, shaking the nearby trees.\r\n\tYou
    yank Denny one more time. With a loud plop! he\u2019s freed from the quicksand.
    But now the tyrannosaur is only a few feet away. It opens its mouth wide and stretches
    its fierce claws toward you.\r\n\tFrantically, you look around for the chronometer.
    You\u2019ve got to get back to the present. But there\u2019s no trace of the stopwatch.
    It\u2019s been sucked into the mud!\r\n\tShould you try to dig the chronometer
    out of the muck? Or try to run away from the tyrannosaur? \n\tWhich will you choose?\n\n\n\tPress
    1, if you decide to dig for the chronometer.\r\n\tPress 2, if you think you can
    escape the tyrannosaur?"
