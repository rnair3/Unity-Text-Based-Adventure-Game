  storyText: "\tAs you back away from the vicious flower, its curling vine sends out
    new shoots.\r\n\tBeyond the plant you see a sign marked EXIT. Can you get around
    the vine and make your escape?\r\n\tOr, off to your right is a rack of garden
    tools. You see a long rake that looks pretty sharp. Maybe you\u2019d better get
    the rake first and fight off the vine.\r\n\tQuick! Make a decision! Will you grab
    the rake first? Or run straight for the door?\n\n\n\tPress 1 to grab the rake.\r\n\tPress
    2 to try to go through the exit."
